Hello! Welcome to my SENG 533 individual final project.

I have created the game of Connect Four. 

To Play:
The server listens on port 3000, so navigate to the IP of the server computer using port 3000.
Nickname - your displayed nickname, remembered in cookies.
Create a game - makes a new game that another player can join by entering the game ID listed on the screen.
Join a game - join a specific game by entering the game ID, or join a random game by leaving blank.
Play a chip - click on the board, and a chip will be played at the highlighted slot. 
Rematch - after finishing a game, click continue, and request a rematch with the opponent, you will be notified
	if the opponent leaves the match. This game can only be joined through the rematch menu.
Color scheme - while in a game, press either left or right buttons to cycle through color schemes. This choice
	is saved in your cookies.

To Run:
NodeJs must be installed, as well as socket.io and express.
In a terminal, navigate the directory this file is in. Type the following command to start:
node server.js
